I learned SQL and then worked through MySQL to update and organize thousands of entries in the Kionix database. The main goal was to have a customer be able to search any sensor and have all the relevant documents from the server show up in an organized fashion (For example if you search 'KX126'). I worked with a website development company to implement the changes in the search and add in filters that sorted documents.

        <button class="accordion">Kionix Slot Car Demo</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>
        I worked on writing software for a demo that Kionix now takes to many sensor expos to promote their sensors. We put a sensor on slot cars and took the data from the Kionix accelerometer (measures acceleration) and magnetometer (measure magnetic flux). Then we then processed the data and displayed it on a user interface in order to create many real world applications of the Kionix sensors to show how functional and versatile they are. Some algorithms I worked on include but are not limited to the terrain detection algorithm and driver profiling. 
      </p>
      <p>

        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Terrain Detection:</b> The idea was to have the car drive over some sort of 'rough' terrain to show the Kionix sensor can be used for vibration analysis in the high frequency domain. I used paper clips to emulate rough terrain. At first, I thought this analysis would be simple, but because the sensor is so sensitive to changes in acceleration It was very difficult to see distinct changes in the acceleration patterns that could be hard coded without giving false positives. So I came up with an algorithm that fed in the most recent .5 seconds of data, and then calculated the average acceleration. After this the algorithm calculated how many distinct positive and negative peaks there were in all three axis of acceleration. I compared the data of how many peaks there were in the three axis when just driving the car around and while driving it over paper clips to then determinree thresholds for number of peaks there should be to consider the terrain 'rough'. After refinement the algorithm had a close to 100% accuracy rate. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Driver Profile:</b> The idea of this algoritm is to rate a driver based on how 'good' or safe the driver of the slot car is. We did this by taking in to account the cars peak accelerations, max g forces and average speed throughout a lap in order to assign the driver a profile score from 1 to 100 based on how good of a driver they were. This could be used by insurance companies to help lower the rate for safe drivers or trucking/transportation companies to ensure their employees are driving safely.

          The goal of this project is to give a verbal command to an R2D2 replica robot and have it autonomously navigate there while avoiding objects. Due to COVID-19 our team had to transition to working online and we created simulations to test our grid representation and algorithm.

        <p>
        <b>Grid Representation:</b> We first created custom classes to represent a grid with tiles. The overarching idea is to represent the robot as a single point, and then "bloat" all objects in the enviroment by treating all the tiles more than 1 robot radius away from the object as object tiles. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Simulation:</b> I created a simulation to help display and test the A* algorithm The simulation generates a random enviroment and then as the robot plans new paths the enviroment is filled in through pseudo sensor data. This sensor data is fed in to the simulation based on where the robot is, and the objects generated around that coordinate. We also wrote code to smooth the paths of the robot to make them look more intelligent using the "line of sight" method

        <h5><b>Autonomous Program</b></h5>
        <p>
          I wrote an autonomous program that won an award at a 24 team Robotics tournament. The goal was to knock your opponents colored ball off, read and decipher a picture mounted on the wall using computer vision and then place a block in the slot that corresponds to the image you recognized. I was able to do all of this and received an award for my use of Gyroscopic and encoder sensor data to orient and guide the robot to place a block in the correct slot. I developed an algorithm that used the law of cosines to correct for error in how the robot drove off of the wobbly platform it started on, and general error in the ending location of the robot (because it did not drive perfectly straight). The high scoring potential of my program helped my team and our alliance win the entire tournament.

        <p> 
        The goal was to have independent user controlled bots that can play laser tag against each other. The game worked such that the user controls the bots using a 'video game' made with unity, which controls the bots both in the game and in real life. The video game also gets feedback from the overhead cameras to determine the bots position in the virtual game.

      <p>
        I worked on the electrical engineering and sensor side of the game helping to integrate the laser tag part of the game. I worked to design and create the circuitry for minibots that could shoot infrared beams and get shot, while also keeping track of their lives with LEDs then video tape and stream the experience for the user and rotate the laser gun with a servo. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I later worked to help expand the robotics kit to include "plug and play" functionality with RJ-12 cables and our custom PCB. I was personally responsible for adding the reflectance sensors and implementing the open source line following algorithm from scratch for the kit.

          Me and a teammate developed a game of laser tag from scratch. We worked to explore the teams minibot platform (explained in previous tab) and expand on it by integrating infrared sensors/emitters sound mechanisms and creating a project that would be a fun, educational and do-able for young adults.

        <p>
          I worked to design the circuitry using raspberry pi and soldered together proto-boards with raspberry pi's to create a fully functioning laser tag system, including a trigger, infrared emitter, an array of detectors on the gun and in the vest, audio feedback, a reset button and LED lights indicating how many lives the player has. 
          
        </p>
        <p>
          I also helped create the software behind the game. I wrote code that interacted with the hardware at a low level getting voltage inputs from sensory information and outputting specific frequencies and voltages to make the system run. We did this using object oriented code that used multi-threading in order to run the many different functions of the game at one time.

          My team worked on a household security device to monitor certain areas of your house with a very simple, compact and low cost device. 
          We built an Arduino project that used motion sensing data from a sensor to send instant text alerts to your phone when activity is detected.
          The device also had the option of a blaring alarm to scare away small children.
          This idea was pitched as a child safety tool for medicine cabinets and gun cabinets but has a wide array of possible usages ranging from ensuring no one steals your money or the kids aren't taking chocolate and cookies too often.

          My team created and pitched a custom paint mixing machine within 24 hours. Our idea was to have a graphic user interface you can use on your computer to select any color on the rainbow spectrum.  
          Then based on the user input the program calculates the amount of Red, Green and Blue paint to mix in order to create the desired shade of paint.

        <p>
          During senior year in my engineering class, me and two others decided to work on a self-driving car project, and our goal was to build a car that could autonomously navigate the school.

        </p>
        <p>
          We managed to build a robot using Arduino's platform, motors, motor controllers, an ultrasonic sensor and infrared sensors. The program told the robot to navigate randomly unless it sensed surroundings. It had infrared sensors at the bottom to ensure it did not drive off stairs, but backed up and turned around. It also had a scanning ultrasonic sensor that scanned to check how far away the walls were around the robot so it could decide which way to drive.

        <button class="accordion">97% on CS 2110 Final Project: Maze Solving</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>
        The final project for 2110 was to work off of a game platform that was given and implement a maze solving algorithm. The goal was to have your character pick up coins worth as many points as possible and then also escape the maze before time ran out. My group developed an algorithm to always pick up the coin worth the most points per unit of movement and then escape when the shortest path to the exit was equal to the number of steps the character had left.

      </p>
      <p>
        We got a 97% which means our algorithms were in the top 30% of the most efficient solutions to the assignment!

        <button class="accordion">100% CS 1110 Final Project: Space Invaders</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>
        In the intro computer science class we had to code a game of space invaders from scratch.

        <p>
        I made the space invaders game and also added extensions to the game such as multiple lives, multiple waves and even power ups (with a partner)!
