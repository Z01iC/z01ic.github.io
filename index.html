        Kionix is a electrical hardware company that designs and builds sensors including accelerometers and magnetometers. As an Intern I worked on a demo to demonstrate the applications of a kionix sensor using slot cars (see project portfolio). After this I worked on cleaning up and updating the SQL database that powers the Kionix website, and updated/ reworked many of the pages from the site using HTML (See project portfolio).

I worked with a website development company to implement the changes in the search and add in filters that sorted documents.

        <p>
          I wrote an autonomous program that won an award at a 24 team Robotics tournament. The goal was to knock your opponents colored ball off, read and decipher a picture mounted on the wall using computer vision and then place a block in the slot that corresponds to the image you recognized. I was able to do all of this and recieved an award for my use of Gyroscopic and encoder sensor data to orient the robot to the correct slot. I developed an algorithm that used the law of cosines to correct for error in how the robot drove off of the wobbly platform it started on, and error general error in the ending location of the robot. The high scoring potential of my program helped my team and our alliance win the entire tournament.

        <div class="panel">
        <p> 
        The goal was to have indepedent user controlled bots that can play against eachother in a game of lasertag. The user controls the bots using a Unity created video game, which controls the bots both in the game and in real life. The game also gets feedback from the overhead cameras to determine the bots position in the virtual game. 

        I worked on the electrical engineering and sensor side of the game helping to integrate the lasertag part of the game. I worked to dsign and create the circuitry for minibots that could should infrared beams and get shot, while also keeping track of their lives with LEDs
        </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Cornell Cup Lasertag</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Me and a teamate developed a game of lasertag from scratch. We worked to explore the teams minibot platform (explained in previous tab) and expand on it by integrating infrared sensors/emitters sound mechanisms and creating a project that would be a fun, educational and do-able for young adults. 
          <img ALIGN="bottom" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"  src="laserTagcirc.png" style = "width:55%">
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked to design the circuitry using rasberry pi and soldered together protoboards with raspberry pi's to create a fully functioning lasertag system, including a trigger, infrared emitter, an array of detectors on the gun and in the vest, audio feedback, a reset button and LED lights indicating how many lives the player has. 
          <img ALIGN="bottom" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5"  src="LaserTag.png" style = "width:55%">
        </p>
        <p>
          I also helped work with the software of the game. I wrote code that interacted with the hardware at a pretty low level getting voltage inputs from sensory information and outputting specific frequencies and voltages to make the system run. We did this using object oriented code that used multi-threading in order to run the many different functions of the game at one time.

        <button class="accordion">Kionix Slot Car Demo</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>
        I worked on writing software for a demo that Kionix now takes to many sensor expos to promote their project. We put a sensor on slot cars and took the data from the Kionix accelerometer (measures acceleration) and magnetomenter (measure magnetic flux) processed the data and displayed it on a user interface in order to create many real world applications of the Kionix sensors to show how functional and versatile they are. Some of the algorithms I worked on include but are not limited to the terrain detection algorithm and driver profiling. 
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfsGEDX1w4k?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </p>
        <p>
        <b>Terrain Detection:</b> The idea was to have the car drive over some sort of 'rough' terrain to show the Kionix sensor can be used for vibration analysis in the high frequency domain. I used paper clips to emulate rough terrain. At first I thought this analysis would be simple, but because the sensor is so sensitive to changes in acceleration It was very difficult to see distinct changes in the acceleration patterns that could be hard coded without giving false positives. So I came up with al algorithm that fed in the most recent .5 seconds of data, and then calculated the average. After this the algorithm calculated how many distinct positive and negative peaks there were in all three axis of acceleration. I compared the data of how many peaks there were in the three axis just driving the car around and while driving it over paper clips to then deterime thresholds for number of peaks there should be to conider the terrain 'rough'. After refinement the algorithm had what seemed to be a 100% succsess rate. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Driver Profile:</b> The idea of this algoritm is to rate a driver based on how 'good' or safe the driver of the slot car is. We did this by taking in to account the cars peak accelerations, max g forces and average speed throughout a lap in order to assign the driver a profile score from 1 to 100 on how good of a driver they were. This could be used by insurance companies to help lower the rate for safe drivers or trucking/transportation companies to ensure their employees are driving safely.

          My team worked on a hosuehold security device to monitor certain areas of your hosue with a very simple compact and low cost device. 
          We built an arduino project that used motion sensing data from a sensor to sent instant text alerts to your phone when activity is detected.
          The device also had the option of a blaring alarm to scare away small children.
          This idea was pitched as a child safety tool for medicine cabinets and gun cabinets but has a wide array of possible usage ranging from ensuring no one steals your money or the kids aren't taking chocolate and cookies too often.

          My team created and pitched a custom paint mixing machine within 24 hours. Our idea was to have a graphic user interface you can use on your computer and select and color on the rainbow spectrum.  
          Then based on the user input the program calculates the amount of Red, Green and Blue paint to mix in order to create the desired shade of paint.

          We managed to build a robot using Arduinos platform, motors with motor control and an ultrasonic sensor with infrared sensors. The program told the robot to navigate randomly unless it sensed surroundings. It had infrared sensors at the bottom to ensure it did not drive off stairs, but backed up and truned. It also had a scannning ultrasonic sensor that scanned to check how far the walls were around the robot so it could decide which way to drive.

My group developed an alogiorhtm to always pick up the coin worth the most points per unit of movment and then escape when the shortest path to the exit was equal to the number of steps the character had.
